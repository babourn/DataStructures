programming assignment 1

for this assignment I implemented several methods

in my removal method The run time was O(N) because I simply had to find the node in the list i and either subtract from its counter or change the links before and after it

in my add methods, the run time was N because I either had to search the list for the right spot to insert the node or find it and add to it's counter.it's best case run time was 0 when I 
knew there was nothing to change.

the print method's run time was O(N) because it just printed off each item in the list.

the reversal sorts run time was O (n) because all it did was run down the list swapping prev and nexts;

I attempted to implement an Insertion sort whose run time would have been O(N log n)
