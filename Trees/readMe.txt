ReadMe.txt

for this assignment I implemented several commands on the tree structure
findMin- which provides the smallest file
findMax- which provides the biggest file
create- asks for a directory and then creates a tree from it
exit- exits the command line interface
save- saves the tree
load- loads a tree from memory
contains-asks for a file and then provides the first instance of the filename
and print- which prints the tree
they're pretty self explanatory
